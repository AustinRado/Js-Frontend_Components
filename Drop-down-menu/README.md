#Note of features I want to implement


Top-level menu bar that is always visible.
Hovering over an item is what brings up submenus
Submenus are separated into two, labeled columns
Submenus that include a portion for images
Submenus are all the same size
Transitioning from one submenu to another is seamless. Rather than closing and opening animations, the contents change
The submenu columns have clickable links, but the top-level option is also clickable (e.g., users can click on “Electronics” but also a specific type of electronics)
Submenu images are also clickable
When a user’s mouse leaves the submenu, it closes

 ##steps I when creating new components:

    Figure out groupings
    Name classes and fill divs with text
    Switch the colors temporarily to give distinct contrast for easier styling
    Apply spacing styles in the order of outer to the inner (e.g., child divs will be styled after their parent ones)
    Switch off ugly temporary colors, use real colors, and style the rest.
